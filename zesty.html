        <h2><em><strong>Special souls...</strong></em></h2>
        <article>
            <p>"At the end of the day, it's about the people who have the ability to lift your soul up more than others. It's about the people who make you feel good about yourself and remind you of the person you are when you have lost yourself. It's about the people who don't let you forget your worth. It's about the people who remind you how much there is to love about yourself and how much you have to offer, even when you are having a hard time seeing it yourself. It's about the people who remind you that there are so many reasons to smile and be grateful. It's about the people who don't let you go through difficult things alone. It's about the people who will hold your hand while your heart breaks and help you put it back together. It's about the people who just want what is best for you. It's about the people who are genuine, good, kind human beings. Sometimes these people need to be reminded just how selflessly special they are."</p>
